# Sharpsend

**Hello, and welcome to Sharpsend**

  Sharpsend is a mobile platform that enables anyone to perform financial operations completely offline. 
  You can send money to any bank account in Nigeria, get instant call credit on any phone number with zero stress, 
  and easily check airtime account balance with one-click of a button. All of this won't have been possible without the use of the 
  SDK provided to us by the amazing folks at Hover, which essentially allows us to perform these USSD operations seamlessly.
  
**Get Started**

  To get started, create a profile on Sharpsend by setting a new username and 4 digits PIN. The PIN will also be needed
  when you want to login. You can also log in with your biometric credentials if you have enabled it in the settings screen. Keep in mind
  that the biometrics authentication would only be enabled if it is supported by the phone itself.
